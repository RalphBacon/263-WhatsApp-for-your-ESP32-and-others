So you need your ESP32 (or other Internet-connected system) to "phone hom" and let you know there is a problem? This simple method of using WhatsApp may be the answer for you.  

For hobbyists, it is ridiculously inexpensive ($4 per YEAR) and easy to implement.  

For businesses, or those with a more complex required, there are very affordable plans to allow messaging any phone and receiving replies, or button clicks and much more!  

I've included some simple (albeit not secure, nor encrypted) code as an example but we'll update this as part of the ESP32 HTML series of videos I'm doing.

### Code
The code you will find in a separate folder above; but bear in mind the URLEncode library may have to be installed separately (especially on the Arduino IDE). Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries** and search for **URLEncode** library by **Masayuki Sugahara**. Simples.
